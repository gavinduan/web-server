# Ridiculously big ass commit.
# Also known as the week after thanksgiving 2006. Or "The day Anoop
# broke Rocks".
#
# Main Changes.
#
# 1. Added a roll-profile.mk file. This is meant as a makefile for building
# the profile rpm containing all the XML files meant for the roll. This is a
# breakaway from the spec.in file method of building the profile RPM.
#
# 2. The variable PWD is now changed to CURDIR. The main reason for this is
# PWD is supplied by the shell. CURDIR is the variable supplied by gmake itself.
# This means we can have a slightly more platform independant way of doing things.
# Also Solaris was failing to set PWD correctly in the source directories, wreaking
# havoc on the location of the BUILD and PKG directories.
